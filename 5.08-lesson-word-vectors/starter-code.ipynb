    "\n",
    "How many meanings can you think of for the word \"set\"? This word [holds the record](https://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/english-word-with-the-most-meanings/) for the most number of meanings in the English language.

    "**Dynamic Word Embeddings** overcome this shortcoming by assigning an embedding to each word after looking at the sentence of the words. This means that the same words (e.g. \"apple\" in a sentence about fruit and \"Apple\" in a sentence about computers) can be represented by different vectors based on their contexts. One of the first popular models that did this was called **ELMo**. Another popular one is named **BERT**.\n",

    "> Like recurrent neural networks (RNNs), Transformers are designed to handle sequential data, such as natural language, for tasks such as translation and text summarization. However, unlike RNNs, Transformers do not require that the sequential data be processed in order. For example, if the input data is a natural language sentence, the Transformer does not need to process the beginning of it before the end. Due to this feature, the Transformer allows for much more parallelization than RNNs and therefore reduced training times.  \n",
